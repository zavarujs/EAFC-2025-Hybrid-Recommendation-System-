# EAFC 2025 Hybrid Recommendation System
This project aims to develop a football player recommendation system based on *hybrid filtering*, combining *content-based* and *collaborative filtering* methods. The initial stages involve data preprocessing, such as normalization and dimensionality reduction using PCA, followed by player clustering using the K-Means algorithm. The system takes into account player attributes, positions, and user preferences when generating recommendations. Performance evaluation using *precision*, *recall*, and *F1-score* metrics indicates a relatively high level of accuracy, although potential biases and a lack of recommendation diversity remain concerns. To improve the system's quality, future development may include expanding the dataset, applying additional filters, and incorporating more diverse evaluation metrics. The provided user interface allows users to manually input search criteria, enabling the system to generate player recommendations that match their needs. Overall, this project demonstrates an effective implementation of a hybrid recommendation system, though further refinement is needed to achieve optimal performance and more comprehensive validation.
